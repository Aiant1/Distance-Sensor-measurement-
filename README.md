# Distance-Sensor-measurement-

## Problem Defination : 
 Make measurements and calculate sensor characteristics!!!In this assignment, we are assuming that you are using a simple distance sensor (having a range 4-30 cm)
Set the (distance) sensor from a known distance to an object. Measure the distance of the sensor from the object with a ruler (or any other reliable distance measurement). Then make several measurements with the sensor (not changing the distance). 

## Once you collected the measurements data, I am calculatng:

arithmetic mean,
median,
distribution, 
variance, 
standard deviation, 
trueness ("accuracy")
